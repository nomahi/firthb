## Firth-type Penalized Estimation of the Modified Poisson and Linear Regressions

The modified Poisson and linear regression analyses have been standard methods for multivariate analyses of binary outcome data in estimating risk ratio and risk difference. Uno and Noma (2023+) <forthcoming> show these multivariate analyses possibly provide biased and/or imprecise estimates under small and sparse data situations (i.e., the “separation” condition). This package provides computational tools of the Firth-type penalized estimating methods for the modified Poisson and linear regressions proposed by Uno and Noma (2023+) <forthcoming>. Also, a bias-corrected sandwich variance estimator under small sample settings is available.
